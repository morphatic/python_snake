# The Class Snake Game in Python

This repo contains the result of following [this tutorial](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/). I completed this project as part of an in-course demo to show the thought processes of a more experienced developer when going through an online tutorial.

## How to follow along at home

1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand part of the screen and create a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account
2. Click the green "Code" button on YOUR copy in your own GitHub space and copy the URL to the repo
3. On your computer from the terminal type:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/python_snake.git
  ```

4. This will clone the repo to your hard drive. Open the folder containing the project in VSCode. The easiest way to do this is from the terminal, type: `code python_snake`
5. Open up the terminal in VSCode
6. Create a virtual environment using the command `python -m venv venv` OR if you are on a Mac, you'll probably need to type `python3 -m venv venv`
7. Activate your virtual environment with: `source ./venv/Scripts/activate` (on Windows) OR `source ./venv/bin/activate` (on a Mac)
8. Install all of the same packages that I installed in my version of the project:

  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

9. Now you should have the latest code as well as all the necessary packages installed locally in your virtual environment and can code right alon side us
